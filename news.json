Natural England and the chair of Englands largest landowners organisation are to meet the new environment secretary to urge him not to scrap or water down rewilding schemes.There has been concern that the new government might roll back nature recovery schemes put in place by the previous administration, in which landowners and farmers are paid for improving nature.We also need to have places for healthy outdoor enjoyment and recreation, we need land for biodiversity and nature recovery, you need land for water infrastructure, and housing.Theres probably more housing going on land with high agricultural value than there is rewilding projects.We do need to accelerate environment land management and we need to see a recovery in nature."}, {"source": "The Guardian", "title": "Prince William
