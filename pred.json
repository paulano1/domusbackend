    "predictiveNews": ["In this future world, the UN has developed a set of global goals, which all countries are expected to achieve by 2030. One of these goals is to ensure that everyone has access to clean water and sanitation.In order to achieve this, the UN has developed a new type of water purification system, which uses artificial intelligence to purify water. This system is known as the AquaBot.The AquaBot is a small, autonomous robot that can purify water using a variety of methods, including filtration, UV disinfection, and reverse osmosis. The AquaBot is powered by renewable energy, and can purify up to 100 litres of water per day.The AquaBot is designed to be used in areas without access to clean water. It can be deployed in a matter of minutes, and does not require any infrastructure. The AquaBot is also very affordable, and is expected to cost less than $100.The AquaBot is just one example of how artificial intelligence is being used to solve global problems. In the future, AI will become increasingly important in solving a wide range of challenges, from climate change to healthcare.", "he average person is now very environmentally conscious and takes steps to reduce their carbon footprint.The average person now recycles, composts, and uses public transportation.

They will seek out foods that are nutritious, sustainable, and delicious.There will be a greater variety of plant-based foods available, as well as more products made from alternative proteins such as insects and algae. Genetically modified foods will be more common, as will foods that have been 3D printed.Nutrition will be personalized, with people using DNA tests to find out which foods they should eat to optimize their health. Food will be delivered directly to people's homes, and meals will be designed to be cooked in minutes using smart appliances.Eating will be a social experience, with people sharing meals and recipes with friends and family online. Food will be used as a way to connect with others and create memories"],
