                ", and a dragon\n\nJason and Emily were walking through the park when they saw a dragon flying overhead. The dragon was so big that it blocked out the sun, casting a shadow over the entire park. Emily was scared, but Jason was fascinated. He had always wanted to see a dragon up close.\n\nThe dragon landed in front of them and lowered its head. Jason reached out and touched its snout. The dragon's eyes were so big that Jason could see his own reflection in them. Emily was still scared, but she was also curious. She reached out and touched the dragon's wing.\n\nThe dragon suddenly lifted off into the air, taking Jason and Emily with it. They held onto each other as they soared over the city. The dragon showed them everything, from the tallest buildings to the smallest alleyways. They even flew over Dusk's house.\n\nEventually, the dragon landed back in the park. Jason and Emily thanked the dragon before running off to tell their friends about their amazing adventure.", 'index': 0, 'logprobs': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop'}], 'usage': {'prompt_tokens': 10, 'completion_tokens': 207, 'total_tokens': 217}}
